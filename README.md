# Iris Dataset Analysis Training

This project is part of a training session conducted for students from Murang'a University of Technology. The goal of the training was to introduce participants to machine learning using Python and the scikit-learn library, focusing on the classic Iris dataset.

## Training Overview

During the training, we covered various aspects of machine learning, including data loading, exploration, preprocessing, and model training and evaluation. The Iris dataset was used to demonstrate these concepts, utilizing tools such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for building and assessing machine learning models.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The project is built using Python 3.x. You will also need to install `pip` and `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment for this project.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install `virtualenv` globally (if you haven't already):**

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

2. **Clone the Project:**

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbuthi/ML-Scikit-Learn-Training.git
```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd ML-Scikit-Learn-Training
```

Create a virtual environment named `venv` (you can name it anything you wish):

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

For Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. **Install Required Packages:**

Install the packages specified in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

With the virtual environment activated and all dependencies installed, you can run the project scripts:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
